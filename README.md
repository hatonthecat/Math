How are memories stored? Perhaps a globular file system? - https://neuron.zettel.page/folgezettel-heterarchy

Imagine a card catalog on the surface area of a sphere, and the mind's eye in the center. 

If thoughts are organized around a sphere (or a sphere of sphere), then the card catalog retriever of the mind can efficiently access knowledge in a pseudo random way, because it auto organizes according to abstract concepts- self defined by the individual- the Folgezettel Heterarchy.
